# Random password-generator
A random password generator using JavaScript is a tool that creates secure and unique passwords for users. This utility employs JavaScript's Math.random() function to generate random characters, ensuring a mix of letters, numbers, and special symbols. Users can typically specify the desired length and complexity of the password, including options for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters. The generator then assembles these characters into a string of the specified length. By using such a tool, users can enhance their online security by avoiding predictable passwords. Implementing this generator is straightforward, requiring basic JavaScript knowledge and understanding of string manipulation. It provides an effective way to safeguard sensitive information against unauthorized access.
